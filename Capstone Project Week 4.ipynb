    "I recently had a chance to relocate to Orlando, Florida, and usually people tend to explore the places before moving to a new country, state, city or place for their work or to start a new life and that involves so many factors including neighborhood analysis. It would be easier if there was some sort of search algorithm that can returns the requested features such as population rate, median house price, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational facilities etc. It’d be nice to have a hassle-free application that could spit out an extensive analysis of all these features for a neighborhood or a comparative analysis between neighborhoods with just sending out the names of the neighborhoods\n",
    "This Project tends to address this requirement as its main idea to help new movers and stakeholders to achieve the desired results, so that it helps them in saving their time and money in finding the right neighborhood and being keep trapped in an infinite loop of extensive search engines.\n",
    "This Project aims to help new movers and stakeholders to take a better decision on choosing the best neighborhood out of many neighborhoods and to build/buy their houses in Orlando city based on the distribution of various facilities in and around that neighborhood. As an example, this project would compare 2 randomly picked neighborhoods and analyses the top 10 most common venues in each of those two neighborhoods based on the number of visits by people in each of those places. Also, this project will be using K-mean clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster the venues based on the place category such as restaurants, park, coffee shop, gym etc. This will help in giving a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two chosen neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood wins over other."
